 # Motivation for the project:

  Earlier, people living in apartments or some sort of society used to discuss
  and solve the problems through face-to-face interactions. Thanks to the
  busy schedules people have developed for themselves and contagious
  environments created by pandemics like corona in recent years, it is
  getting very difficult for residents to have the same old meets.
  Developing a residential management website seemed to be more
  relevant than ever to us. So here we focused on developing a
  sophisticated website under this project, which deals with all the
  problems like resident’s queries, complaints, all amenities-related
  problems, delivery orders, and many more which without an online
  The platform would have become a barrier besides being a resident’s rights.

# Challenges We Ran Into

First of all, it was quite a tedious task to add so many features in just two days. We guys worked a lot on the user interface and tried to make things simple for users. I can list out our shared challenges as follows:

    1. Database management - We spend a lot of time building a proper database to hold all the data. 
    2. Designing webpages - We used a lot of frameworks and libraries to make good user experiences.
    3. Syncing the flow -  We spend a lot of time thinking about the flow and achieving it.
    4. Hosting the files - We faced some issues while taking our database to the server and hosting on AWS.
    5. Designing the dashboard - This was the crucial part of the project, and we nearly spent much time designing a simple but exciting dashboard.

There were other challenges like team management and communication. Hopefully, we solved each of the challenges. 

# Difference from the existing solutions

The existing solutions are not abided with the pandemic situation. So, we are here with some exciting and innovative features like, 

    Scheduling Guest Arrivals with pandemic related norms,
    Scheduling contactless deliveries of parcels,
    Notice Board,
    Lodging Complaints, 
    Handling Security Staffs,
    Looking after security cameras,
    Booking your Amenities safely and securely,
    Pay your society maintenance at your ease,
    Scheduling virtual meets with society members on Agora. 

So having the above features in one place is very rare, and that.’s what makes our application different from others.
